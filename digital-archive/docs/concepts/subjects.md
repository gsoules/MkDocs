# Subjects

An item’s subject says what the item is of or about. 

For example, a book is a type of item in a library, but its subject might be history, biography, or art. In the Archive, the subject of an item of type Image might be People, Places, or Structures. Thus, an item’s type is a broad classification which is narrowed by its subject.

**Below are subjects commonly found in a Digital Archive collection:**

**Businesses**

- Generally commercial in nature, such as hotels, quarries, service stations, stores, and boat shops.

**Events**

- Noteworthy happenings that occur at a specific time and place such as fires, parades, parties, ceremonies, or reunions.

**Organizations**

- Public or private groups of people working together for a common purpose, including schools, libraries, churches, and clubs.

**Other**

- Used when an item’s subject simply does not fall under any of the primary subjects. For example, a photograph of a horse might have subject Other since no other subject encompasses animals.

**People**

- Men, women, and children including generations of local families, summer people, visitors, and those who worked or played here. Though the Digital Archive is not a genealogy database, it does display a person’s spouses, siblings, children, and parents, as well as great and great-great grandchildren and grandparents.

**Places**

- *General* locales such as mountains, cemeteries, hiking trails, and gardens. In contrast, the Place metadata field associates an item with a *specific* town, village, or even a street address.

**Structures**

- Man-made constructions that serve a variety of purposes such as bridges, dwellings, commercial buildings, lighthouses, churches, monuments, and docks.

**Transportation**

-  Items such as automobiles, carriages, fire trucks and railroads. Because boats are such an important subject in the Archive they are treated separately and have their own subject of Vessels.



## Subject Hierarchy

The list above names possible primary subjects, but there are many more specific subjects. A primary subject like Structures is a broad classification, but there are many “flavors” of structures such as Bridges, Commercial, and Dwellings. Some of these can be further classified. For instance, Commercial can be broken down by Lodging and Restaurant, and Lodging can be further classified as Hotel or Inn.

In the Archive, the subject hierarchy is specified using commas, moving from most broad to most specific. Here are some examples:

- Structures, Commercial, Restaurant
- Structures, Commercial, Lodging, Inn
- Structures, Commercial, Wharf, Steamboat

The hierarchy model and syntax for Subject follows the same model and syntax for Type.


### Good to Know

- An item can have more than one subject. For example, the subjects of a photograph of a woman standing in front of a hotel would be People and Hotel (where Hotel is specified as “Structures, Commercial, Lodging, Hotel”).

- People is the only subject that does not have a sub-hierarchy.
