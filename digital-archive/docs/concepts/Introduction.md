# Getting Started - Digital Archive Concepts

**Get the most out of the Digital Archive** by learning about these important concepts:

-   Items & Metadata
-   Types
-   Subjects
-   Relationships

An **item** represents one *thing* in a collection. **Metadata** is information that describes an item such as its title, type, subject,
description, or creator. [Learn about Items & Metadata](../items-metadata).

An item's **type** tells you what kind of thing the item is. For example, an item's type might be *photograph*, *document*, or *teacup*.
An item can have only one type. [Learn about Types](../types).

An item's **subject** clarifies its type. For example, an item of type *photograph* could have the subjects *person* and *boat*. A subject
is not required for items where the type is self-explanatory such *teacup*. A type can have zero or more subjects.
[Learn about Subjects](../subjects).

**Relationships** tell you how items are related to each other. [Learn about Relationsships](../relationships).
