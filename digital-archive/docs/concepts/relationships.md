# Relationships

Relationships are the heart and soul of the Digital Archive. They are what make the Archive different from other databases or Omeka projects you may have worked with. Relationships are like the lines that connect the dots in those puzzles you did as a kid. Without any lines, you only saw dots and numbers, but once you connected the dots, you saw a picture!

Relationships in the Archive are like relationships in the real world. They tell us how two or more people, places, or things are connected to each other. For example, a man owned a boat, resided in a house, and was married to a woman. The words *owned*, *resided in*, and *married to* name the relationships that tell us how the man was connected to the boat, and the house, and the woman.

### Relationship Types

An item in the Archive can have a relationship with one or more other items. The Type of relationship between two items shows the specific nature of the relationship. For instance, a relationship can exist between two people (Mary is *married to* John), between a person and a thing (John *designed* a house), between a thing and a place (John’s house was *located in* a village), and so on. To only say that Mary has a relationship with John, or that John has a relationship with a house, without stating the nature of the relationship, would not tell the whole story.

The type of a relationship must make sense with the two items it relates. For example, only people can be married to each other. A house can be designed by a person or a business, but not by a place or another house. A place can be the location of a house, but a house cannot be located in an event or in a person. A specific set of relationship rules helps archivists accurately and appropriately assign relationships between items. 


### Relationship Direction

A relationship can be either uni-directional or bi-directional. 

A bi-directional relationship reads the same in both directions. For example, John is married to Mary and Mary is married to John. Married to is a label that describes the relationship in either direction.

A uni-directional relationship reads one way in the forward direction and another way in the reverse direction. For example, John designed a house and the house was designed by John. These phrases sound right because the order of the items matches the direction of the relationship. 


### Genealogical Relationships

While the Digital Archive was not designed as a genealogy tool, it automatically determines ancestor and descendant chains starting from the item being viewed. This ancestry feature works for items of type Reference having a subject of People. It automatically follows *child of* relationships to locate parents, grandparents, and so on until the chain ends. It follows the inverse relationship *parent of* to locate children, grandchildren, and so on. The mechanism also automatically identifies siblings. This feature sometimes reveals long ancestry chains that would never be apparent when looking at a single item.


### Viewing Relationships

The fact that every relationship in the archive has a type and direction makes it possible for the Digital Archive software to present related items most effectively when users are viewing relationships for an item. The software:

- Groups related items by relationship type.
- Groups indirectly related items with their directly related item.
- Displays the relationship label for each group relative to the item being viewed, that is, in a direction *from* that item *to* its related items.
- Derives ancestor and descendant chains starting from a People item’s parents and children.
- Lists groups in order of importance (determined by a collection's administrator and archivists).
