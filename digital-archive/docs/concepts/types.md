# Types

Every item has a Type. An item’s type says what kind of “thing” it is. For example, the types of items in a library are books, DVDs, and periodicals, whereas the types of items in a museum of Native American history might be baskets, arrowheads, and pottery. 

**Below are types commonly found in a Digital Archive collection:**

 **Documents**

- Written or printed items such as receipts, advertising, surveys, diaries, deeds, transcriptions etc.

**Objects**

- Physical, three-dimentional objects

**Images**

- Photographs, art, postcards, architectural drawings, and stamps that depict people, structures, vessels, places, and other subjects in the Digital Archive.

**Maps**

- General locales like towns, trails, parks, and islands, as well as locations of businesses, events, and structures.

**Publications**

- Printed or electronic items (usually distributed or publicly available), such as books, clippings, newspapers, directories, and articles that are about the subjects in the Digital Archive.

**References**

- Reference information about a person, place, or thing. The amount of information contained in a Reference item is not always as important as the relationships between the Reference item and other items in the Archive. In many cases, a Reference item serves as “glue” that binds other items together. As such, a Reference item with very little content plays a key role in “connecting the dots” between related items.

## Item Type Hierarchy

The list above names some possible primary item types, but there are many sub-types. A primary type like Image is a broad classification, but there are many "flavors" of images such as Art, Photograph, and Postcard. Some of these can be further classified. For instance, Art can be broken down by Drawing or Painting, and Painting can be further classified as Oil or Watercolor.

In the Archive, the Type hierarchy is designated using commas, moving from most broad to most specific. In the examples below, you can see that each of the three items is an image, but that one is artwork classified as a watercolor painting, one is a cyanotype print of a photograph, and the last is a real photograph that has been used for the picture on a postcard.

- Image, Art, Painting, Watercolor
- Image, Photograph, Print, Cyanotype
- Image, Postcard, Picture, Real Photo

The hierarchy model and syntax for Type follows the same model and syntax as Subject.


### Good to Know

- Each item in the Archive has only one type. In contrast, an item can have more than one subject.
