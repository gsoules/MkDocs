# Items

An item represents a person, place, or thing within the Digital Archive. 

Items are the basic building blocks of the Archive. Each item represents a person, place, or thing and all of its associated information. You may be familiar with the term “record” from working with other databases. If so, you can think of an item as equivalent to the Digital Archive term 'record'.

The information associated with an item can be metadata, a file attachment, or relationships to other items. Each of these kinds of associations are described in the sections that follow.


### File Attachment

Most items in the Archive have an image or document attached to them. Images are either photographs taken with a camera or scans created by a digital scanner. Documents are PDF files that contain information about the item in addition to the item’s metadata.

### Relationships

Relationships are a special kind of metadata that record how two or more items are connected to each other. For example: a man owned a boat, resided in a house, and was married to a woman. The words *owned*, *resided in*, and *married to* name the relationships that tell us how the man was connected to the boat and the house and the woman. Learn more about Relationships
