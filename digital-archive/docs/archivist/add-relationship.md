# Add a Relationship to an Item

This section explains *how* to add relationships to items in your collection.
To learn what relationships are and how they work, read the section on
[Getting Started with Relationships](/relationships/getting-started-relationships/).

## Relationships Quick Start

This first section walks you through the how-to step of adding the frequently used *depicts* relationship
to connect photographs of a person to an item about that person.

**These steps assume you are logged and that you know how to [add a new item](/archivist/add-edit-item/).**

1 &ndash; Clear your Recent Items list
:   Click the **_Clear all_** link on the [**_Recently Viewed Items_**](/user/recently-viewed/#recently-viewed-items-page) page.

2 &ndash; Create a [Reference Item](/relationships/reference-items/) for the person
:   Add a new item with these metadata values:

    -   Type the person's name in the **_Title_** field
    -   Choose `Reference` for the **_Type_** field
    -   Choose `People` for the **_Subject_** field

3 &ndash; Find two or three photos of the person
:   [Search](/user/how-to-search/) your Digital Archive to find a few different photos of your person.
    View each item or flag it for viewing later. Verify that the **_Type_** field
    for each photo starts with `Image, Photograph` 

4 &ndash; Go to the **_Recently Viewed Items_** page
:   Verify that the new Reference Item and your photos are in the list. Click the **_Remove_** link
    on any other items that may have crept in while you were looking for photos.

5 &ndash; Add relationships to the Reference Item for your person
:   -   Click the Reference Item's **_Relationships_** link on the **_Recently Viewed Items_** page

    -   On the **_Relationships for Item_** page:
        -   Choose `depicted by` from the dropdown list in the **_Relationship_** column
        -   Click the **_Add_** button on each of your photographs

6 &ndash; See what you've done
:   -   Click the **_View Public Page_** button to see your person and their photos.

    -   Click the title of one of the photos to see its Reference Item and the other photo()
