# Creating PDFs from scans

This section describes the best way to create a PDF file from one or more scanned documents or photographs.
The best way is one that preserves all of the information your scanner produced and creates a PDF file that
is of sufficient quality for viewing in the Digital Archive, but not so large that it takes a long time to
download or consumes a lot cellular bandwidth. See the section above on upload files to learn why this is important.

### The problem with PDF files

Before learning how to create right-sized PDF files, it may help to understand why PDF files can be so large
and how it's possible to make them smaller with minimal loss of quality.

A PDF file is simply a container for text and images. Typically, a PDF file's pages are letter-sized, that is, they are
8.5" wide and 11" tall though of course there are variations.

This PDF container will happily store an image of any size from small to huge and still display it 8.5" wide on a letter-sized page.
An image's size -- small or huge -- is a function of its resolution as explained on pages 52 - 61 of the 
[Scanning 101 workshop slides](Scanning-101-Workshot-by-George-Soules.pdf). A PDF displays huge images at letter-size
by scaling them down to fit within the page, but the PDF is still storing the huge image, which when combined with huge images on
other pages, makes the PDF file itself enormous.

Fortunately it's easy to create a version of the PDF that stores smaller versions of the images which are still
displayed and look good at letter-size, but can be stored in a much smaller PDF file.

### Steps for creating a right-sized PDF file

-   Configure your scanner software to create TIFF files.
-   Scan the materials using the appropriate PPI (see previous section).
-   Using a separate PDF program like Adobe Acrobat Pro or FoxIt PDF Editor:
    -   Combine the TIFF files into a PDF file.
    -   Optimize the PDF (explained below) to create a smaller version of the PDF file.
-   [Attach the smaller PDF](/archivist/attach-file/#attach-an-image-or-pdf-to-an-item) to a Digital Archive item.
-   Move the TIFF files and the unoptimized PDF to your archival storage area.

By following the steps above, you'll produce a right-sized PDF for uploading to the Digital Archive and you'll
have original high-resolution scans that can be used for close examination of the materials or for making prints.

### Exceptions to the steps above

-   If the material you are scanning does not need to be preserved with the highest quality possible, you can create a PDF
    directly using the scanner software. Just be aware that the images will be compressed within the PDF and therefore will not
    have the same quality as a TIFF file. There are many cases where this is acceptable, for example, when scanning textual
    material such as type-written letters or text pages from a book.
-   You can skip the PDF optimization step if the unoptimized PDF is of an acceptable size. This will often be the case when
    there are not a lot of pages and/or when the PPI is 400 or less.

### How to optimize a PDF file

This section explains how to optimize a PDF file to make it smaller. There instructions are for Adobe Acrobat Pro or FoxIt PDF Editor.
If you are using other software, look to see if similar feature is available.
