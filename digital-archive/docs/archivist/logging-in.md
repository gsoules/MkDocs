Access admin features 

:   Click your name in the dark menu bar to get to the _**Avant Dashboard**_ page.
    From the dashboard you can get to all *backend* features, that is, features that
    only logged in users have access to.

## Avant Dashboard

_**Avant Dashboard**_ page shows you the items you have recently modified and added.
Its top and left **_admin menus_** provide access to a number of features that archivists and
administrators use. When logged in as an archivist you see fewer features
(first screenshot below) than when logged in as an administrator (second screenshot below).

!!! Note "Tip"
    To get back to the public Digital Archive interface, but still stay logged in,
    click the name of your organization at the top left of the dashboard. In the
    screenshots above, the organization name is "Southwest Harbor Public Library."
    While using the public interface, you'll know you are logged in because the dark
    gray menu bar will appear at the top of every page. You can get back to the
    dashboard at any time by clicking your name in the top menu bar.
