## Step 1
> **Go to** the `Add an Item` page

Use *one* of these methods to get to the `Add an Item` page:

* Click the `Add Item` link in the top menu of a Public page, or
* Click the green `Add a new item` link on the Avant Dashboard page, or
* Click the blue `Add New Item` button on the Admin item page

---

## Step 2
> **Enter required field** values

The fields below are required for most Digital Archive sites. Your site might
not require all of them, or it may require others not listed here.

- `Title`
- `Type`
- `Subject`
- `Rights`

*Explain about picking from dropdowns, being able to seearch some of them. If what you
are looking for is not in the list, add it using the Vocabulary Editor.*

If you forget to provide a value for a required field, a red error message will appear
at the top of the page telling you that it's missing.

See [Field descriptions guide](field-descriptions.md) to learn about the fields listed above.

---

## Step 3
> **Enter optional field** values

Most fields are optional, but always provide values for these
if you know the information:

* `Description`
* `Date`
* `Creator`

!!! note ""
    If the item needs more information, an image, or relationships, but you donâ€™t
    have time to work on those things right now, record in the
    [Instructions field ](workflow-fields.md) what still needs to be done.

See [Field descriptions guide](field-descriptions.md) to learn about all fields.

---

## Step 4
> **Decide who** is allowed to see the item

To control whether the item is public or not:

* Check the `Public` box so everyone can see the item, *or*
* Leave the `Public` box unchecked if only archivists can see the item

The `Public` checkbox is located at the upper right of the `Add an Item` page.

If the item is not public, use the `Status` and/or `Restrictions` fields to indicate why.

---

## Step 5
> **Save** the item

To add the new item to the Omeka database:

* Click the `Add Item button` (or the `Save Changes` button if you are making corrections)
  to a newly added item)
* If red errors appear at the top of the page, correct them and try again

  The item is now in the Omeka database. You can [edit the item](edit-item.md) to make changes.

---

## Step 6 (optional)
> **Attach files** to the item

See [How to attach photos or documents to an item]()

---

## Step 7 (optional)
> **Add relationships** to the item

See [How to add a relationship between two items]()

---

## Step 8
> **Review** the newly added item

* Click the **View Public Page** button
* Make sure that the information appears the way you want it
* To make corrections, click the **Edit link** below the last field and go to Step 2

    To learn more, see the [Omeka documentation on adding an item](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Content/Items/).
    However, keep in mind that the user interface for a basic Omeka site
    does not have all the features of the Digital Archive and therefore does not look exactly the same.
