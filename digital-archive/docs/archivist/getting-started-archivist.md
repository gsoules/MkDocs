# Getting Started for Archivists

**Archivists** are staff members and volunteers who maintain a
Digital Archive collection. They have a user name and password that lets
them to log in and see all public items in the collection as well as non-public items
and private fields. They can add new items, edit existing items, attach images
and PDF files to items, edit vocabularies, and establish relationships among items.
An archivist cannot make changes to a Digital Archive installation unless they log
in as an [Administrator](/administrator/getting-started-administrator/).

    -   [Flag items to view later](/user/recently-viewed)
    -   [Share search results with other people](/user/sharing)

See non-public items and private metadata fields
:   An archivist's can search and view all of the data in their organization's

    non-public data in another organization's Digital Archive.

Edit items in the collection

    can make an item public or non-public. They can also delete an item.

    If you are not familiar with the terms *item* and *metadata*, see [Digital Archive concepts](/).  
    To learn about public and non-public items, read about [what gets searched](/archivist/what-gets-searched).

Add new items to the collection
:   An archivist can add a new item to the collection and control whether it is public or non-public.
    The can also attach images and PDF files to the new item.

    [Learn how to add a new item](/archivist/add-new-item)

Attach images and PDF files to items
:   An archivist can attach images and/or PDF files to an item. They can also remove an attachment
    and control the order in which attachment thumbnails apear on the item's page.

    If you are not familiar with item attachments, see [Digital Archive concepts](/).

    An archivist is responsible for managing the archival copies of their digital assets.
    The Digital Archive only stores web-sized images and does not provide features
    for managing archival files. Every orgainzation should have a scheme in place for
    managing and protecting these assets.

Create relationships among items
:   An archivist can establish relationships among items in the collection. For example,
    they can relate all the photographs of a specific person to an item containing information
    about that person. They can also edit existing relationships and remove relationships.
    
    Relationships are by far the most sophisticated feature of the Digital Archive;
    however, the mechanics of adding relationships is fast, easy, and fun once you
    have a thorough understanding of how relationships work.

    Relationships change a site from ordinary to extraordinary and archivists should
    make an effort to learn how to use this important feature.

Edit vocabularies
:   An archivist can edit the terms used for metadata fields that use a vocabulary.
    They can also create new vocabularies for fields that are unique to their site such
    as a **_Status_** field.  
    All Digital Archive sites use vocabularies for these fields:

    -   **_Type_**
    -   **_Subject_**
    -   **_Place_**
    -   **_Rights_**
