# Best Practices

TITLE

An item can have multiple titles, but only if you can say “Also known as” for the alternate title(s).
People are listed by last name first followed by a hyphen. If the person is living, omit the dates. 
The convention for men is as follows:
LastName - FirstName MiddleNameOrInitial LastName (birthdate-deathdate)
Rich - Clifton Melbourne Rich (1882-1971)
Rich - Merton E. Rich (1927-2010)
Rich - Jasper E. Rich
For women use the maiden name for the initial LastName and also include it in parentheses before their married last name:
	Rich - Meredith Adelle (Rich) Hutchins (1939-2016)
Nicknames for people are included in the Title field as follows:
Bracy - Thelma Gwendolyn (Bracy) Hinckley (1913-2005) aka Gwen

D.	Map Titles
Base map titles start with the date of the map (if known) followed by a brief descriptive title taken from the actual title of the map. Additional descriptive information from the actual map title or other text on the map is included in the Description field.

		1887 Map of Mount Desert Island
		1886 Bird’s Eye View of Bar Harbor, Maine
		1903 Part of Ward 9, City of Cambridge
		1921 Sanborn Map of Manset Shore and Southwest Harbor

F.	Date
Unknown birth or death dates – when you know a person is not living, but we don’t know the birth or death date use a “?”:
Gott - Everett Livingston Gott (1875-?)
Gott - Everett Livingston Gott (?-1954)

H.	Creator
The Creator is the “entity primarily responsible for making the content of the resource”. For Article, Document this is the person who wrote the document (e.g. Riebel - Charlotte (Riebel) Morrill). For a photograph, the creator is the person who took the photograph. It is not necessary to specify a creator for Article, Text items with short general descriptions. The Creator field is optional, but when specified, must match exactly the Title of the item for that creator.
