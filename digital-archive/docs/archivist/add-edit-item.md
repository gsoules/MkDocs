## Tips & Tricks

**Searching within lengthy dropdown menus**

Databases with a large number of items may have many options for Type, Subject, and Rights. Instead of scrolling through a lengthy dropdown menu, you can type into a search field at the top of the dropdown menu to narrow your options.

**Duplicating an existing item**

Once you have created and saved an item to the database, you can make a copy of it using the **_Duplicate This Item_** button in the menu on the right. You will see a new **_Add Item_** page appear, containing all of the same information as the original, but with its own Identifier number. The **_Title_** field now includes the word ---DUPLICATE--- as a reminder.

## Step 8
> **Review** the newly added item

* Click the **View Public Page** button
* Make sure that the information appears the way you want it
* To make corrections, click the **Edit link** below the last field and go to Step 2
