# Items, Types & Subjects

Items, Types, and Subjects frame a significant portion of information within the Archive, and are important terms to become familiar with. Each is defined in detail on this page, along with details for its use, examples, and relevant notes.

## Items

Items are the basic building blocks of the Archive. Each item represents a person, place, or thing and all of its associated information. You may be familiar with the term “record” from working with other databases. If so, you can think of an item as a record in the Digital Archive database.

The information associated with an item can be metadata, a file attachment, or relationships to other items. Each of these kinds of associations are described in the sections that follow.





### File Attachment

Most items in the Archive have an image or document attached to them. Images are either photographs taken with a camera or scans created by a digital scanner. Documents are PDF files that contain information about the item in addition to the item’s metadata.

### Relationships

Relationships are a special kind of metadata that record how two or more items are connected to each other. For example: a man owned a boat, resided in a house, and was married to a woman. The words *owned*, *resided in*, and *married to* name the relationships that tell us how the man was connected to the boat and the house and the woman. Learn more about Relationships

## Types

Every item has a Type. An item’s type says what kind of “thing” it is. For example, the types of items in a library are books, DVDs, and periodicals, whereas the types of items in a museum of Native American history might be baskets, arrowheads, and pottery. The types of items in the Digital Archive are:

## Subjects

An item’s subject says what the item is of or about. For example, a book is a type of item in a library, but its subject might be history, biography, or art. In the Archive, the subject of an item of type Image might be People, Places, or Structures. Thus, an item’s type is a broad classification which is narrowed by its subject.

### Subject Hierarchy

The list above names the primary subjects, but there are many more specific subjects. A primary subject like Structures is a broad classification, but there are many “flavors” of structures such as Bridges, Commercial, and Dwellings. Some of these can be further classified. For instance, Commercial can be broken down by Lodging and Restaurant, and Lodging can be further classified as Hotel or Inn.

In the Archive, the subject hierarchy is specified using commas. Here are some examples:

- Structures, Commercial, Restaurant
- Structures, Commercial, Lodging, Inn
- Structures, Commercial, Wharf, Steamboat

### Good to Know

- An item can have more than one subject. For example, the subjects of a photograph of a woman standing in front of a hotel would be People and Hotel (where Hotel is specified as “Structures, Commercial, Lodging, Hotel”).

- People is the only subject that does not have a sub-hierarchy.
