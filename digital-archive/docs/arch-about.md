# Archivist documentation

---

**Archivist** documentation is for archivists and volunteers who maintain the collection content
for a Digital Archive site. They add new items, edit existing items, upload images, and establish relationships among items.

An archivist has a user name and password that allow them to login to a Digital Archive site. Once logged in, they
can see all public items in the collection as well as non-public items and private data associated with all items.

Typically, an archivist's login will not allow them to make changes to the Digital Archive installation unless
the archivist is also an [Administrator](admin-about.md).
