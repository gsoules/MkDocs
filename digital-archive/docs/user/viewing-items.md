# Viewing Items

## Lightbox
Both the Table View Detail Layout and the Grid View display thumbnails for an item's image, if it has one. If the item has no image, a placeholder image is displayed. When you click on a thumbnail, a large version of the image is displayed without leaving the page you are currently on. Click the arrows to the left and/or right of the image to preview the other item images in the search results. Doing so only changes the image preview - you are still on the page with your initial search results. 

Each Lightbox image is displayed with a set of metadata, including the item title, ID, and image link that opens the image by itself on a new page. Click 'View Item' To view the full page the image is associated with. 

Close the Lightbox image and return to search results by clicking the red X in the information bar, or by clicking anywhere outside of the image.
