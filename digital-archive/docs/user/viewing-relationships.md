# View Related Items

When you view the page for one item in the Digital Archive, you also see other items in the
collection that are related to the item you are viewing.

The example below shows the page for an item about a man named Howe Higgins. In the lower
right you can see the thumbnails of some of the related items. There are three photos of him
and below those, just as the screenshot gets cut off, an item about his wife.

On the left side of the page, in the **_Relationships_** section, is a *visualization* preview that
graphically depicts all of the related items. The visualization gives you a quick sense
of how this item is related to others, and the thumbnails that extend down the page, below
the item's metadata, let you see each related items.

## Visualization

The image below shows the visualization you see when you click the **_Enlarge_** link that appears
just above the visualization preview shown in the screenshot above. In a Digital Archive visualization,
the item you are viewing, known as the primary item, appears with a green border around it.
In this example, the primary item is 13178.

To keep the graph from becoming too cluttered, groups of two or more items having the same relationship
to the primary item are consolidated into expandable purple dots. When you click on the dot, the graph
changes to show those items. The screenshot below shows what you see when you click on the purple dot
showing 4 in the center.

In the expanded graph, you can click on the purple dot in the center, or click on the primary item
at upper left, to go back to the previous graph. In any visualization graph, you can
click on a thumbnail to go to that item's page.
