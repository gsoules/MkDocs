# Viewing Relationships

Relationships are the heart and soul of the Digital Archive. They are what make the
Digital Archive different from other databases or [Omeka](https://omeka.org/classic) projects
you may have worked with. Relationships are like the lines that connect the dots in those
puzzles you did as a kid. Until you drew the lines, all you saw was dots and numbers,
but once you connected the dots, you saw a picture!

Relationships in the Digital Archive are like relationships in the real world. They tell us how
two or more people, places, or things are connected to each other. For example, a man owned
a boat, resided in a house, and was married to a woman. The words *owned*, *resided in*, and
*married to* name the relationships that tell us how the man was connected to the boat
and the house and the woman.

## Viewing Relationships

When you view an item in the Digital Archive, you also see thumbnails and titles of related items along with a graphical visualization depicting the relationships among items. You instantly see how the item you are viewing fits in with the rest of the collection. You can view a related item by clicking on its thumbnail image or title. Clicking on a thumbnail shows you a large version of that itemâ€™s image and lets you quickly browse every other image on the page. The screenshot below shows the page for an item and its relationships.

### Visualization

The image below shows the visualization you see when you click the `Enlarge` link on the visualization
preview shown in the screenshot above (just below the **_Relationships_** section at left). The item
you are viewing, known as the primary item, appears with a green border around it. In this example, the
primary item is 13178.

To keep the graph from becoming too cluttered, groups of two or more items having the same relationship to the primary item are consolidated into expandable purple dots. When you click on the dot, the graph changes to show those items. The screenshot below shows what you see when you click on the purple dot showing `4` in the center.

In the expanded graph, clicking on the purple dot in the center, or on the primary item
at upper left, takes you back to the previous graph. In any visualization graph, you can
click on a thumbnail to go to the item's page.
