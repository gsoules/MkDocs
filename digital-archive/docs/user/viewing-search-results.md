# Viewing Search Results

You can view search results in three ways:

- Table View
- Grid View
- Index View

Within each view, you can choose how to sort the results to further organize the information.

---

**To manipulate the different view options and layouts**, use the selector bar at the top of the search results page.

### Table View

**Table View** is the default view for a set of search results. Items are listed one at a time, each item occupying an individual row.

**To view only items with images**, use the Items menu to select *With Images*.

**To customize the results in Table View**, use the Layout menu on the selector bar. Each Layout option displays the same list of search results, but with differing types of information visible in the list of results. The screenshot below shows results in Table View, with a Type/Subject layout.

### Grid View

**Grid View** displays search results as a grid of thumbnails.

**To view only items with images**, use the Items menu to select *With Images*.

### Index View

**Index View** displays search results consolidated into unique groups, alphabetically or numerically. Numbers in parentheses indicate how many items belong to an individual group within the index when there is more than one item per group.
