# Viewing Search Results

You can view search results in three ways:

- Table View
- Grid View
- Index View

Use the **_View_** selector to choose a view. The selector is located in the options bar at the top of
the search results page. You can use the other selector bar options to sort and further organize results

## Table View

Table View with the Details layout is the default view for search results. It shows each item on 
a separate row that includes a thumbnail image and many of the item's metadata fields. The
**_Description_** field uses blue highlighting to show keywords in the metadata that match the
search keywords. In the example below, the search keywords were `waldron bates`.

If an item in the search results has a PDF file attached to it, the PDF file's name appears under
`File Attachment` with a clickable link to immediately open the PDF. Keyword hits within the
PDF text are highlighted in blue. In the example above, that last item has a PDF file named
`ANP Pathmakers.pdf`.

#### Compact Table View Layouts

You can see the same results in a more compact layout by choosing a different option from the **_Layout_** selector.
The example below shows the same results in the `Type / Subject` layout. Digital Archive administrators can create custom layouts.

You can sort the columns in a compact layout by clicking on a column header. In the example above, the
results are sorted by relevance, not by any column. You could however, for example, sort by item type by
clicking on the **_Type_** column as shown in the screenshot.

You can also sort by choosing a metadata field
name using the **_Sort by_** selector. To change the sort from ascending to descending and vice versa,
use the selector and choose the field again.

### Grid View

**Grid View** displays search results as a grid of thumbnails. The example below shows the same results
as the examples in the Table View section above.

You can  sort items in Grid View by choosing a metadata field name using the **_Sort by_** selector.
To change the sort from ascending to descending and vice versa, use the selector and choose the field again.

#### Hiding Items that have no Image

In the example above, notice the second item in the first row. It has a placeholder icon for
a map, but no map image. This is an example of an item that has no image or PDF file attached to it. You
can hide items like that using the **_Items_** selector to choose
`With images`. When the selector says `Items: With images`, only items have an attachment will appear in
the search results. This works in both Grid View and Table View.

### Index View

Index View displays search results as an alphabetized index of unique values for a single metadata field that you choose
using the **_Index by_** selector.

The example below shows that same search results as shown in the Table View and Grid View sections above. In the 
example, the results are indexed by the **_Title_** metadata field.

The next example shows all of the items in a collection that have type `Image` indexed by the **_Place_** metadata field.
Numbers in parentheses indicate how many items have that Place. For example, 30 photographs are of Acadia
National Park when it was known as Lafayette National Park.

The example below shows the same search results as the one above except they are indexed by the **_Type_** field.
Because all the types are images, they are all indexed under the letter `I`, but the index shows what kinds of
images are in the collection and their quantities.

 You can click on an entry, such as the one for `Tintype`, to see its eight items as shown below.

### Good to Know

**To preview an image** without leaving the search results, click on its thumbnail from the search results or on an item's individual page. Use the arrows to the left/right of the image to preview other item images in the search results.
