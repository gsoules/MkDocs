# Sharing

You can share your search results with other people by emailing them a link they can click to see the results. Here’s how:

-   [Perform a search](../how-to-search)
-   On the search results page, copy the URL from your browser’s address field
-   Email the URL to a friend or colleague

The results URL for a search look something like this:

```
http://swhplibrary.net/digitalarchive/find?query=school+students
```

Note that the URL for a can be quite long. That's okay.
Just copy it from your browser and paste it into an email.

When the recipient clicks the link, they'll see the same results presented
using the same **_View_**, **_Layout_**, **_Sort by_**, **_Per page_**, and
**_Items_** options that you used.
