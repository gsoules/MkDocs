# Viewing Related Items

When you view the page for one item in the Digital Archive, you also see other items in the
collection that are related to the item you are viewing. Not every item has related items,
but some have quite a few as shown in the very long screenshot below for item 7280.

On the left side of the screenshot, in the **_Relationships_** section, is a *visualization* preview that
graphically depicts all of the this item's related items. A
[closeup of the visualization](/user/viewing-related-items/#visualization) appears after the screenshot.
Thumbnails for each related item appear under the items's metadata grouped by the type of relationship.
The groups are separated by horizontal gray bars.

Every item page has this same form. The visualization provides a high level
view of the item's relationships and the thumbnails provide an image and title for every related item.
You can click the title of a related item to go to that item's page, or you can click its thumbnail to see
a larger picture.

## Visualization

The image below shows the visualization you see when you click the **_Enlarge_** link that appears
just above the visualization preview in the screenshot above. In a visualization,
the item you are viewing, known as the primary item, appears with a green border around it.
In this example, the primary item is 7280. In this visualization it appears at the top, but 
the primary item can appear anywhere within the visualization depending on the layout.

This visualization reveals that item 7280 has
[direct relationships](/relationships/kinds-of-relationships/#direct-relationships) to the four items on
the middle row, and [indirect relationships](/relationships/kinds-of-relationships/#indirect-relationships)
to all of the items on the bottom row.

To keep the graph from becoming too cluttered, groups of two or more items having the same relationship
to their primary item are consolidated into expandable purple dots. When you click on the dot, the graph
changes to show those items. The screenshot below shows what you see when you click on the purple dot
that has "5" in the center.

In the expanded graph, you can click on the purple dot in the center, or click on the primary item
at upper right, to go back to the previous graph. In any visualization graph, you can
click on a thumbnail to go to that item's page.
