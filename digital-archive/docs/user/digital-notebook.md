The Digital Notebook:

-   Lets people create a personal account to save and share items from any of the shared
    collections into one or more folders that they create.

    feature set, but using the Digital Archive user interface.
-   Allows a user to use the PDF Report feature to “print” the items in a Notebook folder
    to a PDF file which they can then send to someone or print on a printer.
