# Using the Digital Notebook

!!! Note ""
    The Digital Notebook feature is not yet supported.

The Digital Notebook:

-   Lets people create a personal account to save and share items from any of the shared
    collections in one or more folders that they create.
-   Is based upon the Digital Commonwealth Folder feature. Based on means the same overall
    feature set, but using the Digital Archive user interface.
-   Allows a user to create a PDF Report to “print” the items in a Notebook folder
    to a PDF file, which they can then send to someone or print on a printer.
    It works the same way as creating a PDF from search results.
