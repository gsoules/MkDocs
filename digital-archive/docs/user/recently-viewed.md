# Flagging Items to View Later

You can flag items in search results that you want to view later so that you can quickly find them
without having to search for them again.

!!! Note ""
    This flagging feature works ony when you are searching the site you are on.  
    It does not work when you are [searching all sites](/user/what-gets-searched/#terminology).

The example below shows search results in [Grid View](user/viewing-search-results/#grid-view)
for five items. The user is about to click the title on the first item to learn more about it.
However, before clicking the title, they clicked the flag icons on items 13325 and 14997 to mark
them for viewing later. A blue flag indicates that an item is in the recently viewed items list
(even if you have not actaully viewed its item page). You can unflag an item by clicking it again
which makes it turn gray.

### Recently viewed items page

Continuing with the example above, after viewing item 13178, the user could click
the `Recent Items` link, located below the search box, to go to the **_Recently Viewed Items_** page.
The page shows the item that they they just viewed, followed by the two items that
they flagged earlier.

On the **_Recently Viewed Items_** page, you can:

-   Click a title to go to that item's page
-   Click a thumbnail to view the item's image in the popup lightbox 
-   Click the `Remove` link to remove am item from the list
-   Click the `Clear all` link to remove all items from the list
-   Click the `Show as search results` link to view all of the items as search results

### Show recent items as search results

You can use the flagging feature as way to create a set of results that you want to share with someone else.
A common sequence for using the feature is to:

-   Clear all the recently viewed items
-   View and/or flag items that you want to share
-   Click the `Remove` link on any items that you don't want to keep in the list
-   View the list as search results
-   Send the search results to a friend or colleage

When the user clicks the `Show as search results` link in the previous example above,
the three items appear as search results as shown below.
You can share results with someone else by sending them the search results page URL. 
[Learn about sharing search results](/user/sharing).

!!! Note "Notes"
    The list of recently viewed items is stored in [browser cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie).
    If you clear your browser's cookies, or switch to a different browser, or don't
    look at the **_Recently Viewed Items_** page for several days, the list will be empty.

    The `Recent Items` link does not appear under the search box when there are no recent items.

    The recently viewed items list only tracks items that you have viewed of flagged when searching
    `This site`. It does not track items when you are viewing `All sites`.
