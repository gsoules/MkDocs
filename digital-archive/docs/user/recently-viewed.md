# Flagging Items for Later

You can mark items that you want to view later so that you can find them again without starting a new search.

You can see flagged items in the **_Recent Items_** list along with recently viewed items.

You can remove individual items from the list or clear the entire list at any time. You can also
display the list as search results so that you can share them with someone else or
[print them to a PDF file](../pdf-report).
