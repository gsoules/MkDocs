# Flagging Items for Later

You can mark items in search results that you want to view later so that you can quickly find them
without having to search for them again.

!!! Note ""
    This feature works ony when you are searching the site you are on.  
    It does not work when you are [searching all sites](/user/what-gets-searched/#terminology).

The example below shows search results in [Grid View](user/viewing-search-results/#grid-view)
for five items.    

![Thumbnails showing recently-viewed flags](recently-viewed-1.jpg)

You can see flagged items in the **_Recent Items_** list along with recently viewed items.

You can remove individual items from the list or clear the entire list at any time. You can also
display the list as search results so that you can share them with someone else or
[print them to a PDF file](../pdf-report).

You can only flag items when viewing `This site`
