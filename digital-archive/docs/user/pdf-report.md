# Creating a PDF Report

!!! Note ""
    The PDF Report feature is not yet supported.

The Reports feature will “print” search results to a PDF file having the same layout,
and a similar appearance to, the search results that are presented
as chosen using the **_Layout_** dropdown on a search results page.

An administrator will be able to *configure* a new report by virtue of adding a new layout
using the AvantSearch plugin configuration page.

An **_Item Report_** will print an item’s image(s) and metadata to a PDF file.
