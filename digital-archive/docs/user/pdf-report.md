# Creating a PDF Report

!!! Note ""
    The PDF Report feature is not yet supported.

The Reports feature will “print” search results to a PDF file using the same layout as,
and a similar appearance to, the results displayed on a search results page.
To control the layout of the search results, use the **_Layout_** selector on the options bar at the 
top of the search results page.

Administrators will be able to *configure* a new report by adding a new layout
using the AvantSearch plugin configuration page.

An **_Item Report_** will print an item’s image(s) and metadata to a PDF file.
