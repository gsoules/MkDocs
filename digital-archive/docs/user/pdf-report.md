# Creating a PDF Report

You can create PDF files for search results and individual items.

Item report
:   To create a report for a single item, click the **_Save this item as a PDF file_** link
    that's located on the left side of an item page below the **_Citation_** section.

Search results report
:   To create a report for  **_Table View_** search results, click the 
    **_Save these results as a PDF file_** link that's located at the end of the search results page.
    You cannot save search results for **_Grid View_** or **_Index View_**.

Administrators can *configure* a new search results report by adding a new layout
using the AvantSearch plugin configuration page.
