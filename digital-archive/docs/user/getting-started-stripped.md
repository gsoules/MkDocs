## Viewing Search Results

A search can produce many items. You can use the selector bar at the top of the search results list to choose how you want to view the items by using the three view options:

- Table
- Grid
- Index

You can sort the items in any of the view options to see them organized by categories such as date or creator.

## Flagging Items to View Later

You can mark items that you want to view later so that you can find them again without starting a new search. You can find flagged items in a list that also includes recently viewed items. You can remove items or clear this list at any time to help you keep track of your search process.
