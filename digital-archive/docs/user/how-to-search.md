Some Digital Archive sites are set up to share information with multiple organizations. If you are searching in a Digital Archive that is connected to other organizations, you have the ability to search in all sites, or just the one you are on. 

**To search all sites**, use the *searching* menu to select `All sites`. Notice that a dark blue connector icon appears beside options in the selector bar menus as a reminder that you are searching items from all connected sites.

**To search just the site you're on**, use the *searching* menu to select `This site`.

**To search by individual fields**, click the *Advanced Search* link underneath the search box in the upper right. This feature allows advanced users to narrow their search using specific qualifiers and parameters. Learn more about Advanced Search.
