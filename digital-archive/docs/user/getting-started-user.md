# Welcome

Welcome to the Digital Archive! 

The Digital Archive (or simply “Archive”) is an online database of historic and contemporary images, maps, articles, documents, publications, and other items curated by an organization's archivists, librarians, researchers, and community members.

## The Digital Archive Experience

Traditional databases show one item at a time, and the better ones include links to related items. You start by viewing one item and then chase links one by one to view related items. Soon, however, you are far from the original item of interest, and have likely lost your train of thought or purpose at least once along the way.

In contrast, when you view an item in the Digital Archive, all of its related items instantly appear on the same page. The page even shows a graphical visualization depicting the relationships among items. You never have to chase links or leave the item of interest. A more complete 'picture' begins to form as you explore, revealing connections and stories of individual items that may have never become clear when presented as singular items on individual pages. 

These real-world interconnections are what makes our lives rich today and what make history so fascinating. For a database to display information about a man, a boat, a boat designer, a woman, and five children, without also revealing the relationships among them, is to show the data, but hide the story. The Digital Archive seeks to record data and establish connections among items, and present it all in a way that is both visually enticing and informative. Happy Exploring!
