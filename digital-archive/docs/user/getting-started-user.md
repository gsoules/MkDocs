# Getting Started for Users

**Users** are people who use the Digital Archive for research or just for fun.
They can see all public items in a Digital Archive collection, but have
no access to non-public items or private fields. A user cannot edit or add items
unless they log in as an [Archivist](/archivist/getting-started-archivist/) or
[Administrator](/administrator/getting-started-administrator/).

**To get started using the Digital Archive as a user:**

    -   **_Table view_** with compact rows showing sortable columns of metadata
    -   **_Grid view_** showing only images and titles

Flag items to view later
:   You can mark items that you want to view later so that you can
    quickly find them again without doing a new search. Just click the little flag icon beside the item number.

    are viewing them.
