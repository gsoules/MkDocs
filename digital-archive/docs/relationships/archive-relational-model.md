# Archive Relational Model

The Archive Relational Model is a new approach for recording and presenting images and
information about people, places, events, organizations, and objects in the real world.
It provides archivists with a structured, but easy to use method for presenting their
collections online in a way that engages users by making it fun and easy to learn about local history.

## Key concepts

The basis of the Archive Relational Model is that each item in the Digital Archive serves as a
digital stand-in for something in the real world such as a man or a boat. The key to understanding the
model is to think of an item that is *about* a man as the man himself, and to think of an item
that is *about* a boat as the boat itself. In this same way, we can think of the digital scan of a
photograph of the man on his boat as the original photograph. The scan is a stand-in for
that piece of chemically treated paper that depicts a moment in time.

In the real world, the man owned the boat, and the photograph depicts the man and the boat.
The words *owned* and *depicts* are relationships. The Archive Relational Model lets us record
these very same real world relationships as digital relationships.

The phrasing of a relationship depends on your perspective. The man *owned* the boat,
but from the perspective of the boat, it was *owned by* the man. The *owned by* relationship is
simply the inverse of the *owned* relationship. The model and the software allow archivists
to establish relationships between two items from the perspective of whichever item they happen
to be working with.

Most relationships are established between what are called **Reference Items** in the model.
An explanation of this key concept is deferred until later following further discussion of relationships.

## Story telling

Relationships are what make the world go round. A photograph of a man on his might not be
very interesting by itself, until you know the story behind it. When you learn that the man
who owned the boat tended a lighthouse located on an island where he lived with his wife and
their eight children, one of whom was lost at sea while fishing from that boat.
Now that's interesting.

An online collection that does not tell stories by revealing the relationships among its items,
serves only as a repository for information. Users must search to locate items of interest with
no easy way to tell if or how one item it related to another. In contrast, the Digital Archive
supports and encourages a discovery process that is fun, but more importantly, is essential if an
organization wants the public to fully appreciate the content of their collection.

## Establishing Relationships

To enable this powerful story telling feature, archivists establish relationships among items
in the collection. Once they understand the model and learn the mechanics of relating one item
to another, it's quick and easy to do and can be performed little by little over time as
resources allow. Users benefit immediately each time a new relationship is added.

The Archive Relational Model both encourages and enforces good practices for entering item metadata
and establishing a relationship between two items. The user interface for adding relationships is not
only quick and easy to use, it also prevents an archivist from inadvertently setting inappropriate
or non-nonsensical relationships such as a man married to a boat. The software enforces the use
of appropriate relationships based on [relationship types](/relationships/relationship-types/) and  
[relationship rules](/relationships/relationship-rules/) that each organization defines
for their collection.

When an organization first adopts the Archive Relational Model, it defines the kinds of relationships
that make sense for items in the collection. The organization also specifies rules that must be followed
when an archivist adds a specific relationship between two items. An example of a rule is that only a
person can be married to a person. Another rule is that a photograph can only depict an item that is a
stand-in for a person, place or thing. For example, a photograph cannot be married to a person, because
as discussed earlier, the photograph is not the person, but only a stand-in for a chemically treated
piece of paper having an image of a person at one moment in time.

## Reference Items

In the Digital Archive, a **Reference Item** is used to relate other items to each other.
The concept of a reference is central to the Archive Relational Model and is the key to
establishing relationships among  the items in your collection.

!!! note "Mind Bender"
    It takes a while to get your mind wrapped around the concepts discussed on this page.
    Once you get a feel for how it actually works, and after you see how your collection begins to come
    alive after you have added some relationships, it will make a lot more sense and not seem
    so complicated.  
    If you are anxious to just get started adding some relationships to your Digital Archive collection, see
    the [Relationships Quick Start ](/archivist/add-relationship/#relationships-quick-start) section.
