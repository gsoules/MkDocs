# Getting Started with Relationships

Relationships are the heart and soul of the Digital Archive. They are what make the
Digital Archive different from other databases or [Omeka](https://omeka.org/classic) projects
you may have worked with. Relationships are like the lines that connect the dots in those
puzzles you did as a kid. Until you drew the lines, all you saw was dots and numbers,
but once you connected the dots, you saw a picture!

Relationships in the Digital Archive are like relationships in the real world. They tell us how
two or more people, places, or things are connected to each other. For example, a man owned
a boat, worked for a business, and was married to a woman. The words *owned*, *worked for*, and
*married to* are relationships that tell us how the man was connected to the boat
and business and woman.

!!! note "Big Topic"
    Relationships are the most sophisticated and powerful feature of the Digital Archive.
    As such, it takes time and effort to understand and learn how to use them. Approach this
    topic with that in mind so that you don't become overwhelmed. If you are anxious to just
    get started adding some relationships to your Digital Archive collection, see the
    [Relationships Quick Start ](/archivist/add-relationship/#relationships-quick-start) section.
