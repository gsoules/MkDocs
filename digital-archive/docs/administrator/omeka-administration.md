# Omeka Administration

Omeka provides features that administrators can use to customize their
Digital Archive site. You can learn how to use most of these features by reading the
[Omeka Classic Documentation](https://omeka.org/classic/docs). This page provides
some additional guidance.

## Add or edit menu items

An administrator can create new menu items and their corresponding pages.
To learn how, read these sections from the Omeka Classic user manual:

-   [Navigation](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Admin/Appearance/Navigation/)
-   [Simple Pages](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/SimplePages/)


## Set the default Home page

The Home page is the one that appears when a visitor first comes to your site.
It is also the page that gets displayed when they click on the banner that appears at the top of every page.

The home page can be an informative page like **_About_** or **_Browse_**, or it can be search results.
To learn how to set the home page, read these sections from the Omeka Classic user manual:

-   [Add a navigation link to the home page](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Admin/Appearance/Navigation/#add-navigation-links)
-   [Choose the home page](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Admin/Appearance/Navigation/#choose-a-homepage)

Here are some examples of navigation links you could use for the home page. To use these examples, replace `mysite.net` with the domain name for your site.

```
https://mysite.net/digitalarchive/find?query=&view=4&limit=100
https://mysite.net/digitalarchive/avant/dashboard
https://mysite.net/digitalarchive/find

```

## Add a new user

See the [Add a New User](/administrator/add-new-user/) page in this documentation.

## Work with Omeka elements.

To learn how to add, rename, or reorder Omeka elements, see the [Omeka Elements](/administrator/omeka-elements/)
page in this documentation.

## Make bulk edits

Occasionally you man have the need to change the values of a large number of metadata fields, for example to
fix a typo or use different wording. When the field is **_Type_**, **_Subject_**, or **_Place_**, you can
easily and safely make bulk changes using the [Vocabulary Editor](/archivist/vocabulary-editor/). For other
fields, you can learn how to use the [Omeka Bulk Metadata Editor](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/BulkMetadataEditor/) plugin.

Before using the bulk editor, be aware of the following:

-   Like any kind of 'global replace' feature, bulk editing can result in unintended changes and there is no undo.
    Be sure you know what you are doing.
-
