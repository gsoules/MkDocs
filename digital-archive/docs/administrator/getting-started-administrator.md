# Getting Started for Administrators

An **Administrator** maintains their organization's Digital Archive site.
They have special privileges that let them change the appearance of the site,
add menu items, configure plugin options, add new users, define relationship
types and rules, and use other administrative features that
[Archivists](/archivist/getting-started-archivist/) don't have access to.
