# Getting Started for Administrators

An **Administrator** maintains their organization's Digital Archive site.
Their user name and password lets them log in with special privileges.
They can change the appearance of the site, add menu items, configure plugin options,
add new users, define relationship types and rules, and use other administrative
features that [Archivists](/archivist/getting-started-archivist/) don't have access to.
