## Terminology
This section explains the meaning of commonly used Omeka terminology.

Item
:   An *item* contains information about an object in your collection including its metadata,
    attached images and documents, and a record of when the item was created and by whom.
    The metadata for an item is stored in *elements.*

Element
:   An *element* is a container for a single metadata value. When you are editing
    an item, you enter data into metadata fields, one for each element.
    Examples of elements are `Title`, `Description`, `Creator`, and `Date`.

Super administrator
:   An Omeka `super administrator` is someone having an Omeka login that allows them to do anything and everything in Omeka.
    Super administrator are the only users with access to the top navigation tabs for Plugins, Appearance, Users, and Settings.
    See the [Omeka Users](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Admin/Users/) documentation to learn about user levels and access.
