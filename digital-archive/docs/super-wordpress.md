**A how-to guide for maintaining Digital Archive documentation hosted on WordPress**

---
    
> [WordPress](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a static website generator for building project
> documentation written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Markdown is a very
> simple markup language used to create formatted documentation (like you see on this page)
> in a plain text file without having to use a program like Microsoft Word.
> The combination of MkDocs and Markdown makes it possible for multiple authors to produce
> consistent looking documentation, keep it up to date, and make it accessible online.
