# Install a new Digital Archive site

This page explains all of the tasks that AvantLogic performs to install and configure a new Digital Archive installation. For each task, it lists the steps necessary to perform the task.

!!! note "Step by step"
    Installation tasks appear in the navigation panel at left. Perform them one at a time in the order listed.

    **[Print an installation checklist](installation-checklist.pdf)**

---
## Prerequisites
---

**Hosting requirements**

The web host must be an Apache web server that satisfies the 
[system requirements](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Installation/System_Requirements/)
for [Omeka Classic](https://omeka.org/classic/). AvantLogic uses
[InMotion Hosting](https://inmotionhosting.com/) as its host.

These instructions assume that the host has [cPanel]. If you don't have cPanel, see [Installing on a bare Linux server](#installing-on-a-bare-linux-server).

**Site name**

Some of the installation steps require that you specify a *site name*. Choose a concise and
meaningful name that you and others will recognize when performing system administration. An acronym
is usually a good choice. For example, the site name for the Southwest Harbor Public Library is `swhpl`.

### Site folder

The files for a Digital Archive installation reside in what this documentation refers to as the site folder.
The location of the folder varies depending on whether the installation is standalone (has its own cPanel
account on the server) or is a subdomain installation (shares the same cPanel account as other installations).

**Standalone installation folder**

On a standalone installation, the Digital Archive files will be installed in `/public_html/digitalarchive`. AvantLogic uses
the `digitalarchive` folder to isolate the Digital Archive files
from other applications on the web server. For example, some installations use a `digitalarchive`
folder and a `wp` folder side-by-side where the `wp` folder contains a WordPress application
for content related to the Digital Archive collection. If would be very messy, and
make application updates difficult, if the Digital Archive and WordPress files were
together in the same `public_html`.

!!! warning ""
    **Do not** create the `digitalarchive` folder at this time.  
    It will get created later during the *Install Omeka Classic files* step.

**Subdomain installation folder**

On a subdomain installation, the Digital Archive files will be installed in `/domains/site-name` for a subdomain e.g. `demo.digitalarchive.us`.
Create the subdomain now before continuing.

-   Go to cPanel for `digitalarchive.us`
-   Use the `File Manager` tool to create a new subfolder in the `domains` folder e.g. `/domains/demo`
-   Choose the `Domains` tool
-   Click the `Create a New Domain` button
-   Enter the domain name e.g. `demo.digitalarchive.us`
-   Enter the document root e.g. `/domains/demo`
-   Leave the share document root option unchecked
-   Click the `Submit` button

---
## MySQL database

Follow the steps below to use [cPanel] to create a new empty database and a database user for the Digital Archive installation.

### Standalone installation

#### Create a database

!!! warning "Important"
    cPanel will automatically prefix any database or user name that you choose with the
    first seven letters of the domain name, followed by `_`. For example, if you specify
    the name `omeka` and the domain name is `swhpl` the actual name will be `shwpl_omeka`.
    Keep this in mind because the name you choose will really be a suffix.

-   In WHM, select the account where the installation will be performed
-	Go to [cPanel] and choose `MySQL Database Wizard`
-	In wizard Step 1 Create a Database:
    -   Decide on the database name suffix
        -   A good choice is `omeka`
    -   Enter the suffix in the **New Database** field
-	Click the `Next Step` button

!!! note
    If you want to populate the new database with data from an existing Digital Archive database, follow the instructions to
    [copy a MySQL database](/technology/mysql/#copy-a-server-database-to-use-on-localhost).

#### Create a user

-	In wizard Step 2 Create Database Users:
    -   Decide on the user name suffix
        -   A good choice for a standalone installation is `archivist`
        -   A good choice for a subdomain installation is `admin`
    -   Enter the suffix in the **Username** field
-   Click the `Password Generator` button
-   In the popup dialog:
    -   If you don't like the password, click the `Generate Password` button to get another
    -   **Copy the password to a password vault or other safe place**
    -   Click the checkbox confirming that you copied the password to a safe place
    -   Click the `Use Password` button
    -   The two password fields get filled in with the generated password automatically
-	Click the `Create User` button
-	In wizard Step 3 Add user to the database:
    -   Check the `ALL PRIVILEGES` checkbox at the top
    -	Click the `Next Step` button

### subdomain installation

#### Create a database

-	Go to [cPanel] and choose `MySQL Databases`
-	In the Create New Database section enter the site name e.g. `demo` as the database name
-	Click the `Create Database` button
-   On the database added page, click `Go Back`
-   In the Add User To Database section
    -   Choose `daus_admin` as the user
    -   Choose the new database name as the database e.g. `daus_demo`
    -   Click the `Add` button
-   On the Manage User Privileges page
    -   Check the  `ALL PRIVILEGES` box
    -   Click the `Make Changes` button


### Configure MySQL Workbench

This step is only necessary for a standalone installation. For a subdomain installation, the new
database will already be availale in MySQL Workbench as one of the `digitalarchive.us` databases.

-   [Add a database connection to MySQL Workbench](mysql.md#add-a-database-connection)

---
## Omeka installation

### Copy installation files to server

Follow these steps to upload the Omeka Classic files to the web server. You can also read
[Omeka's installation instructions](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Installation/Installation/).

-	Download the latest Omeka Classic release from <http://omeka.org/classic/download>  
    As of 11/22/2023, the latest release was `omeka-3.1.2.zip`
-	Go to [cPanel] and choose `File Manager`

#### Standalone installation
-   Navigate into the `public_html` folder
-   [Upload and extract the zip file](linux-server.md#upload-and-extract-a-zip-file)
-   A new folder having the same name as the zip file will appear
-   Rename the new folder from the zip file's name to `digitalarchive`
-   Delete the zip file.
-   Copy `C:\laragon\www\favicon.png` to the `public_html` folder

#### Subdomain installation
-   Navigate into the site folder e.g. `domains/demo`
-   [Upload and extract the zip file](linux-server.md#upload-and-extract-a-zip-file)
-   A new folder having the same name as the zip file will appear
-   Navigate into  the new folder
-   Select all of the files and move them to the site folder e.g. `domains/demo`
-   Navigate back up to the site folder
-   Delete the zip file
-   Delete the now empty folder having the same name as the zip file
-   Copy `C:\laragon\www\favicon.png` to the site folder

---

### Edit database configuration

Follow these steps to configure Omeka to use the database you created.
The *username*, *password*, and *dbname* values come from the [create MySQL database](#create-mysql-database) task.


-	Go to [cPanel] and choose `File Manager`
-	Navigate *into* the site folder
-   Edit `db.ini`
-	Replace occurrences of `"XXXXXXX"` as follows:
    -	**host**     = `"localhost"`
    -	**username** = "*database username*"
    -	**password** = "*database password*"
    -	**dbname**   = *"database name*"
    -	**prefix**   = `"omeka_"`
    -	**charset**  = `"utf8"`
    -	Leave **port** commented out
-	Save your changes and close the file

To learn more, see the Omeka documentation for the [database configuration file](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Technical/DatabaseConfigurationFile/).

!!! warning "Important"
    The `db.ini` file tells Omeka how to access the database. Any errors, typos, or incorrect information
    in this file will prevent Omeka from running and result in the display of a fatal error.

---

### Enable error reporting and HTTPS

This step allows PHP errors to appear in the browser. Normally you would not want
this for a production site, but it's better to become aware of a problem if it occurs.

In these steps you'll also add code to force URLs to https. The code gets added here and in the root-level `.htaccess` file
and in the steps to [configure site security](#configure-site-security).

-	Go to [cPanel] and choose `File Manager`
-   Allow hidden files to be displayed:
    -   Click the `Settings` button in the upper right of the File Manager
    -   Check the box for `Show Hidden Files`
-	Navigate *into* the site folder
-   Edit `.htaccess`
-	Uncomment `SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV development`
-   Add the code below to force URLs to HTTPs
-	Save your changes and close the file

Put the code below immediately after the line `RewriteEngine on`

```
# Force all URLs to HTTPS
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]
```

---

### Enable error logging and background process

Follow these steps to enable Omeka error logging so that a history of errors will be recorded.
To learn more, see the Omeka documentation for [retrieving error messages](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Troubleshooting/Retrieving_Error_Messages/#activate-error-logging).

-	Go to [cPanel] and choose `File Manager`
-	Navigate *into* the site's `application/config/` folder
-   Edit `config.ini`
-	Change `log.errors` from `false` to `true`
-   Change `background.php.path` from blank to `/usr/local/bin/php`
-	Save your changes and close the file

Errors are written to:

-   `digitalarchive/error_log`
    -   Okay to delete â€“ it gets recreated automatically. Shows PHP errors.
-   `digitalarchive/admin/error_log`
    -   Okay to delete â€“ it gets recreated automatically
-   `digitalarchive/application/logs/errors.log`
    -   Must exist â€“ will get Omeka error if not present and writable.  
        If the file gets too
        big for cPanel  to allow editing, you can delete the file and create a new one with the same name.


If errors are not appearing in the browser, make sure that display_errors=On and error_reporting=32767 (or E_ALL).
These two settings can be applied in php.ini, but since there can be multiple php.ini files, it's not always clear
which applies.

---
## Omeka configuration

You are now ready to launch Omeka and configure site settings.

-	Open a browser using the URL for the `digitalarchive` folder, for example:
    `avantlogic.net/digitalarchive`.

The Omeka `Configure Your Site` page should appear.

![Site settings](install-digital-archive-1.jpg)

### Enter configuration settings

You can now configure the Omeka site. See the Omeka
[general settings](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Admin/Settings/General_Settings/)
documentation and the
[appearance settings](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Admin/Appearance/Appearance_Settings/)
documentation for an explanation of the configuration settings.

!!! note "Super user"
    The username and password you will specify below are for an Omeka *super user*.  
    See [Omeka terminology](../../administrator/omeka-elements/#terminology) to learn what it means to be a super user.

-   Set:
    -	**Username**: *a super user name*  
    -	**Password**: *super user password*

-	Click the `Admin Dashboard` button
-	Login with the super user user name and password
-   Check the `Remember Me` checkbox
-   Click the `Login` button
-   The `Dashboard` page should display.

---

### Configure additional settings

Follows these steps to finishing configuring Omeka.

** Appearance settings**

-	On the `Dashboard page`, click `Appearance` in the top menu bar
-   Click `Settings` in the `Appearance` page menu bar
-	At the bottom of the page, uncheck `Show Element Set Headings`
-	Click the `Save Changes` button

** Search settings**

-	Click `Settings` in the top menu bar
-   Click `Search` in the `Settings` page menu bar
-	Uncheck all `Search Record Types` except `Item`
-	Click the `Save Changes` button

** General settings**

-   Click `General` in the `Settings` page menu bar
-	Click the `Test` at the bottom of the page  
    You should see `The ImageMagick directory path works`
-   If the message says that the path does *not* work:
    -   Go to [cPanel] and choose `Terminal`
    -   In the terminal window, type `which convert` and press `Enter`
    -   Use the response to determine the correct path and try again 
        or contact your host's technical support and ask them to tell you the path 

---

### Change database storage engine
!!! note ""
    This step is only necessary when using AvantSearch **without** AvantElasticsearch. 

These steps change the storage engine for the `search_texts` table from `MyISAM` to `InnoDB`. They also add a `FULLTEXT` index to the `title` column of the `search_texts` table. To learn the reason for making these changes, see the AvantSearch
plugin topics on [improving search results](../../plugins/avantsearch/#improving-search-results)
and the [Titles Only option](../../plugins/avantsearch/avantsearch/#titles-only-option).

Follow these steps to change the storage engine:

-	Go to [cPanel] and choose `phpMYAdmin`
-	In the left panel, click on the Omeka database name to see its tables
-	Click on the `omeka_search_texts` table in the left panel
-	Click on the `Operations` tab
-	In the `Table Options` section, change **Storage Engine** from `MyISAM` to `InnoDB`
-	Click the `Go` button in the lower right of the section
-	Click on the `omkea_search_texts` table
-	Click the `Structure` tab
-	On the row for `title`, click `Fulltext` among the actions at the far right.
    If the browser window is too narrow to see all the options, click on `More`
    and choose `Fulltext` from the dropdown menu
-	On the `Confirm` dialog click the `OK` button to alter the table
-	`Title` now appears in the `Indexes` section showing with Type as `FULLTEXT`
-	Close the phpMyAdmin browser tab

### Disallow bots

Crawling of Digital Archive sites by Google and other major search engines is generally a good thing;
however, some commercial bots can hit a single Digital Archive site as often as 100,000 times a day or more.
The `robots.txt` file is used to block specific bots while allowing others to access the site. As of
September 2020, the bots listed below were the worst offenders, though their behavior was not malicious.

To see bot traffic, use the cPanel tool Awstats and click the Robots/Spiders visitor link in the left panel.

Edit (or create) `public_html/robots.txt` to contain the content below:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /files/

User-agent: AhrefsBot
Disallow: /

User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /
```

---

### Configure PHP settings

-	Go to [cPanel] and choose `MultiPHP INI Editor`
-   Select the `Basic Mode` tab
-   Choose the site from the dropdown menu
-   Set:
    -   **max_execution_time**: 120
    -   **memory_limit**: 512M
    -   **post_max_size**: 128M
    -   **upload_max_filesize**: 128M
-   Click the `Apply` button

---

### Verify PDF support

These steps verify that a program called `pdftotext` is installed on the web server.
It is used by the  `AvantElasticsearch` plugin to 
make PDF files searchable. If you won't be using `AvantElasticsearch`, you can skip this task.

-   Go to [cPanel] and choose `Terminal`
-   In the terminal window, type `pdftotext -v` and press `Enter`
-   The `pdftotext` program should display its version
-   If instead you see `command not found`, ask your host to install `pdftotext`

---

### Verify that background processing works
Some Omeka operations are performed in the background. Examples are a request to reindex records
and using the Bulk Edit plugin to perform bulk edits in the background.

Follow these steps to determine if the default configuration for background processing is working properly.

-	Click `Settings` in the top menu bar
-   Click `Search` in the `Settings` page menu bar
-	Click the `Index Records` button (even though there are no records to index)
-   You should see a green message `Indexing records. This may take a while...`
-	If instead you get an error that the configured PHP path is  or does not point to a PHP-CLI binary:
    -	Edit `digitalarchive/application/config/config.ini`
    -	Set `background.php.path` to the correct path for the server e.g. `/usr/local/bin/php`
    -   Save changes and close the `config.ini` file
    -	Verify that the Index Records operations works with no error

!!! note ""
    Finding the right path might be a trial and error process. Leaving `background.php.path = ""` works correctly on some servers. On others it needs to be set to `/usr/local/bin/php` or `/usr/bin/php-cli`.
    If you are not successful, contact the host to ask for the right path. Also read the next section.

#### Installations that don't support background processing

Some installations such as XAMPP on Windows might not support background processing. In that case, you can
have background jobs run in the foreground. To do this, edit the Omeka core file `/application/config/config.ini`
as shown below:

```
jobs.dispatcher.default = "Omeka_Job_Dispatcher_Adapter_Synchronous"
jobs.dispatcher.longRunning = "Omeka_Job_Dispatcher_Adapter_Synchronous"
;jobs.dispatcher.longRunning = "Omeka_Job_Dispatcher_Adapter_BackgroundProcess"
```

When upgrading to a new release of Omeka, make sure that you edit the file again.

---
## Plugin acquisition

It is now time to acquire the zip files containing the plugins, and the theme, required
by the Digital Archive. This section explains where to locate the files and how to add
them to the installation so that later you can install and configure them and each plugin.
To *add* them means to upload them to the web server and extract them into the proper installation folders.

### Get Digital Archive zip files

The following zip files are required for most Digital Archive installations.
All the files are located on GitHub. The link on the zip file name takes
you to the GitHub repository for that file.

Delete these two folders for plugins that the Digital Archive does not use:

``` plaintext
public_html/digitalarchive/plugins/Coins
public_html/digitalarchive/plugins/ExhibitBuilder
```    
The `plugins` folder on the web server should now look like this:
![GitHub download](install-digital-archive-8.jpg)

---
## AvantTheme configuration

AvantTheme, and many of the AvantPlugins, depend on the AvantCommon plugin being installed.
Before you can install the theme, install AvantCommon by following these steps:

-   Login to Omeka as a super user
-	Click `Plugins` in the top menu bar
-   Many of the plugins added in the previous task will be shaded in pink
-   Click the `Install` button for AvantCommon
-   On the `Configure Plugin: AvantCommon` page:
    -   Don't enter any values for now
    -   Click the `Save Changes` button

-   AvantTheme is now the current theme

### Remove unused themes

-   Use [cPanel] to navigate *into* `public_html/digitalarchive/themes`
-	Delete all the theme folders except AvantTheme

---
## Item elements definition

Omeka installs with a number of different *Item Types* and *Elements*; however, the Digital Archive
uses only one Item Type which contains all of the Dublin Core elements plus only those additional elements
that the organization needs. Having just one Item Type makes data entry easier and faster. To
learn more, see the Omeka documentation for [Item Types](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Content/Item_Types/).

Follow the steps below to remove unused Item Types and Elements and
create a single Item Type having the elements needed by the organization.

---

###	Delete unused item types
-   Open the database in [MySQL Workbench](mysql.md#open-a-database)
-	Right click on the `omeka_item_types` table and choose `Select Rows`
-	Select all the rows
-	Right click on the selection and choose `Delete Rows`
-	Click the `Apply` button in the lower right
-	Click the `Apply` button on the `Apply SQL Script to Database` dialog
-   When the deletion completes, click the `Finish` button

---

###	Delete unused elements
-	Right click on the `omeka_elements` table and choose `Select Rows`
-	Select all the non Dublin Core element rows. Those rows have an  
    `element_set_id` value of `3` and are named `Text`, `Interviewer`, `Interviewee` etc.
-	Right click on the selection and choose `Delete Rows`
-	Click the `Apply` button in the lower right
-	Click the `Apply` button on the `Apply SQL Script to Database` dialog
-   When the deletion completes, click the `Finish` button

You can now quit MySQL Workbench.

---

###	Create a new Item Type
-   Login to Omeka 
-	Click `Items Types` in Omeka's left admin menu
-	Click either of the green `Add an Item Type` buttons
-	For **Name** use the *site name* in all caps, for example `NEHL` for Northeast Harbor Library
-	Leave the description blank
-	Click the `Add Item Type` button

The new Item Type contains all of the Dublin Core elements. If you know what other elements
the organization needs, you can add them now, or you can
[add additional elements](#add-additional-elements) as the last task of the installation.
The Administrator documentation explains how to [add a new element](../../administrator/omeka-elements/#add-a-new-element).    

---
### Add additional elements

See the Administrator documentation on how to [add a new element](../../administrator/omeka-elements/#add-a-new-element).    
Also, arrange the order of all elements.

---

### Arrange element order
The default order in which the Dublin Core elements appear when editing an item is not
suitable because the Identifier and Type fields appears near the end. Follow the instructions to
[arrange the element order](../../administrator/omeka-elements/#arrange-element-order) into the
recommended sequence for the Digital Archive.

## Plugin installation

You are now ready to install the plugins that turn an Omeka installation into the Digital Archive.

At this point in the installation, the plugin files have been uploaded to the web server and will
appear on the Omeka `Plugins` page; however, most of the plugins have not yet been installed
as is evidenced by the green `Install` button.

![Install button](install-digital-archive-9.jpg)

Once a plugin is installed, it shows buttons that let you configure, deactivate, or uninstall it.

-   Click the `Sign In to the Console` button at upper right
-   Enter the Account ID ending in `4548`
-   If the page says **_Sign is as IAM user_**, click the `Sign-in using root user email` link
-   Enter the root user email
-   Enter the root user password
-   Provide the Google Authenticator code
-   You should now be on the **_AWS Management Console_** page

-	Copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** to the `AWS Keys` tab of the `Digital Archive Accounts` Excel sheet  
    *This is the only opportunity to obtain the secret key*
-	Click the `Done` button

## Install the AvantElasticsearch plugin

Follow these steps to install and configure the [AvantElasticsearch] plugin:

**Create a folder needed by the AvantElasticsearch plugin**

-   Go to [cPanel] and choose `File Manager`
-   Navigate *into* the `files` folder of the site folder
-   Create this subfolder: `files/elasticsearch`

**Install the AvantElasticsearch plugin**

-	Go to the Omeka `Plugins` page
-	Click the `Install` button for `AvantElasticsearch`

#### Edit es.ini

Follow these steps to allow the installation to share its items with other Digital Archive installations via the shared AWS Elasticsearch index:

-   In cPanel, edit `es.ini` in the site folder
-   Set `shared_index_name` to the name of the shared index e.g. `acadia`

!!! danger "Shared Index"
    **FOR ADMINISTRAOR ACCOUNT ONLY:** If the account needs to be able to create a new local or shared index, add:
     `new_local_index_allowed = true` and/or `new_shared_index_allowed = true`
      to the `es.ini` file which is located in `/digitalarchve` (in the same root
      folder as `db.ini`). This will cause new radio buttons to appear on the
      Elasticsearch page to allow import into a new index. This is an especially
      dangerous operation for a shared index because it will destroy all the data
      for all sites in the shared index and therefore should only be performed
      when creating a shared index that does not already exist.

#### Configure the AvantElasticsearch plugin
-   Set **Contributor Id** e.g. `swhpl`
-   Set **Contributor** e.g. `Southwest Harbor Public Libary`
-   Set **Host** to the AWS Domain Endpoint which can be found in:
    -   The `AWS Keys` tab of the `Digital Archive Accounts` Excel sheet and on AWS and in
    -   `Amazon OpenSearch Service > Domains > digitalarchive`
    -   Example: `search-digitalarchive-6wn********************o4q.us-east-2.es.amazonaws.com`
-   Set **Region** to `us-east-2`
-   Set **Key** and **Secret** to the keys obtained in the step above to create AWS credentials
-   Check **Local Index**
-   Check **Shared Index**


### Enable Elasticsearch in AvantSearch
-   Go to the configuration options page for the [AvantSearch] plugin
-   Check the **Elasticsearch** checkbox

---
## AvantVocabulary

!!! note ""
    Skip this task if the installation will not be using AvantVocabulary.

Follow these steps to install and configure [AvantVocabulary]:

-	Go to the Omeka `Plugins` page
-	Click the `Install` button for `AvantVocabulary`
-   On the `Configure Plugin` page, leave `Delete Tables` unchecked
-   Click the `Save Changes` button
-   Click `Vocabulary Editor` in the left admin menu
-   Click the `Rebuild Common Terms table` button and click `OK` on the confirmation dialog
-   Wait for the build to report that it has completed (it writes about 30,000 records)
-   Click the `Rebuild Local Terms table` button and click `OK` on the warning dialog
-   Wait for the build to say that it has completed and will reload the page (this will be very fast on a new installation)


### Add vocabulary terms
At this stage the only vocabulary terms that will be set for the site are Places which is kind `4` in the site terms table. If you look at the table you'll see that those are the only kind of rows there.

You'll now need to add some Type and Subject terms so that the organization has something to work with.

!!! note "Work Around"
    There is currently an issue with the AvantVocabulary plugin whereby you can't add a new term unless there is at least one term in the table.To work around this, manually add one Subject (`Image, Photograph`) and one Type (`People`) to the site terms table using MySql Workbench as shown below.

![Site terms table](install-digital-archive-11.jpg)

Note that to eliminate the default value of null, in the `site_term` column, you'll need to first add a value of one space, apply the changes, then delete the space and apply again.

Now go to the **_Vocabulary Editor_**, click the `Rebuild Local Terms table` button and click `OK` on the warning dialog.

The two terms should show and and you should now be able to add new terms.

Suggestions for an initial set of Types:
``` text
Document, Correspondence, Letter
Image, Photograph
Map
Object, Writing, Postcard
Publication, Clipping, Newspaper Clipping
Reference
```

Suggestions for an initial set of Subjects:
``` text
Nature, Animals
People
Places, Island
Structures, Commercial, Lodging, Hotel
Transportation, Automobile
```

## Subdomain installation

This section discusses installing the Digital Archive in `public_html/digitalarchive` versus installing it in a subdomain.
A subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger domain. For example, `west.example.com` and `east.example.com`
are subdomains of the `example.com` domain. Note that `example.com` is actually a subdomain of the top-level domain `com`.

Subdomains are different from folders. For instance,
`example.com/digitalarchive` points to the `digitalarchive` folder within the `example.com` domain whereas
`digitalarchive.example.com` is a subdomain of `example.com`.

### Two cases
There are two cases to consider when installing the Digital Archive in a subdomain.

1. The subdomain is hosted on the domain's web server
2. The subdomain is hosted on a different web server

### Case 1 - subdomain is hosted on the domain's web server

Examples:
```
    site1.avantlogic.net
    site2.avantlogic.net
```
This case applies when using subdomains for hosting multiple instances of the Digital Archive
on the same web server for development and testing purposes. The following sections point out some
things you should be aware of.

Learn [how to create a subdomain](/technology/install-digital-archive/#site-folder).

**Database name and user**

When you install the Digital Archive in more than one subdomain on the
same web server, the corresponding databases and user names will all share the same
prefix that cPanel assigns automatically. As such, you'll need to use unique suffixes
to indicate which installation a database belongs to.

For example, on the avantlogic web server where the prefix is `avantlog`, instead of
following the recommendation to name the database `avantlog_omeka`, choose database
names like `avantlog_site1` and `avantlog_site2`.

Similarly, for the database user name, instead of following the recommendation to name
the user `avantlog_archivist`, choose user names that match the database names such as 
 `avantlog_site1` and `avantlog_site2`.

**FTP**

You don't need to set up separate FTP connections for each subdomain.
You access a subdomain's files via the domain's FTP connection. If for some reason
you need a separate FTP connection for a subdomain, the connection cannot use the SSH protocol,
but must instead use the FTP protocol. For related documentation on this see
[Filezilla FTP settings](../../administrator/zoomable-images/#filezilla-ftp-settings) for uploading zoomable images.

### Case 2 - subdomain is hosted on a different web server

Example:
```
    digitalarchive.somecollege.edu
```

In the example, the Digital Archive files are installed in the `public_html` folder on a web server
that is different from the `somecollege.edu` web server. On that different web server, the files are
installed in `public_html` instead of in a `digitalarchive` folder because if they were, the URL
would need to be `digitalarchive.somecollege.edu/digitalarchive` which is redundant.

To make this work, that is, for the subdomain ending in `edu` to resolve to another server,
the `somecollege.edu` web administrator must point an `A record` or CNAME for the subdomain to the
web server that hosts the subdomain. (CNAME is recommended as future-proof against server migrations).

With this arrangement, you can perform the tasks to [install a Digital Archive site](install-digital-archive.md)
with only one modification: Instead of installing into the `digitalarchive` folder, install into the
`public_html` folder.

Because you will be installing into the `public_html` folder, the code to force HTTPS for all pages
needs to go into the `.htaccess` file that ships with Omeka in its top-level folder. Add the
code below near the top of the file after `RewriteEngine on`. Don't add code for redirecting root access.

```
    # Force all URLs to HTTPS
    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
    RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]
```

## Installing on a bare Linux server

This section provides a few tips for installing on a remote server that does not have cPanel.

First, see [Linux server administration](/technology/linux-server) and pay particular attention to the places
that provide information on how to perform operations using the command line and ignore the places that refer to
WHM and cPanel.

### SSH
You can perform command line operations using [OpenSSH](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui) that is built into Windows 10 and 11. To connect to the remote server using SSH:

-   Open a Windows terminal window (Command Prompt)
-   Type `ssh` followed by the host name of the remote server
-   Enter the password (does not show anything as you type)

```text
    C:\Users\username>ssh foo.bar.net
    username@foo.bar.net's password:
    Last login: Wed Mar  6 07:30:19 2024 from 74.75.232.104
    [username@foo ~]$
```

You can now type Linux commands the same as you would using a cPanel Terminal window.

### Troubleshooting

#### 404 error when trying to go to any Omeka page

This problem can occur if `mod_rewrite` is not installed. See [404 and Not Found](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Troubleshooting/#404-and-not-found)
in the [Omeka Classic User Manual](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/).

The problem could also occur if the `.htaccess` file is not getting executed. One reason this could happen is if you leave the `.` off the
beginning of the file name. You could try introducing an error into the file to determine if it is being executed.

#### Destination directory is not writable error

You'll get this permissions error when you attempt to add an item with a file attachment.

See [Setting Directory Permissions](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Installation/Setting_Directory_Permissions/#setting-directory-permissions)
in the [Omeka Classic User Manual](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/).

The problem occurs if the web server process doesn't have write access to the `files` directory and everything under it.
The solution will depend on your server, but assuming that the web server runs as user `apache` you could do `chown -R apache` on the `files` directory to get the result below.

``` text
[username@foo digitalarchive.bar.org]$ ls -l files
total 1180
drwxrwsr-x. 125 apache digarc    4096 Mar  6 13:12 fullsize
drwxrwsr-x.   2 apache digarc 1130496 Mar  6 13:02 import
drwxrwsr-x. 125 apache digarc    4096 Mar  6 13:12 original
drwxrwsr-x. 125 apache digarc    4096 Mar  6 13:12 square_thumbnails
drwxrwsr-x.   2 apache digarc      68 Mar  5 11:30 theme_uploads
drwxrwsr-x. 125 apache digarc    4096 Mar  6 13:12 thumbnails
```
