# Administrator documentation

---

**Administrator** documentation is for the person who performs administrative functions for their organization's Digital Archive site. They edit vocabularies, configure plugin options, add new user accounts, define relationship types and rules, and perform other similar tasks.

An administrator has a user name and password that allow them to login to a Digital Archive site. Once logged in, they
have all the privileges of an [Archivist](arch-about.md), but can also perform administrative functions.
