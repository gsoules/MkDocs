## Documentation categories

The documentation is divided into categories for these kinds of people:

- Users
- Archivists
- Administrators
- Developers

A fifth category is documentation about Digital Archive plugins that is of broad interest.

Each category is explained below. Some people will fall into more than one category.  
For example, an administrator is usually also an archivist and a user.

### User documentation
User documentation is for people who use the Digital Archive for research or just for fun.

A user (also commonly referred to as an end-user) can see all public items in a Digital Archive collection,
but has no access to non-public items, or private data associated with all items.

### Archivist documentation
Archivist documentation is for archivists and volunteers who maintain the collection content
for a Digital Archive site. They add new items, edit existing items, upload images, and establish relationships among items.

An archivist has a user name and password that allow them to login to a Digital Archive site. Once logged in, they
can see all public items in the collection as well as non-public items and private data associated with all items.

Typically, an archivist's login will not allow them to make changes to the Digital Archive installation unless
the archivist is also an **Administrator**.

### Administrator documentation
Administrator documentation is for the person who performs administrative functions for their organization's Digital Archive site. They edit vocabularies, configure plugin options, add new user accounts, define relationship types and rules, and perform other similar tasks.

An administrator has a user name and password that allow them to login to a Digital Archive site. Once logged in, they
have all the privileges of an **Archivist**, but can also perform administrative functions.

### Developer documentation
Developer documentation is for technical people responsible for maintaining multiple Digital Archive sites. They are responsible for database management, programming, software upgrades, web server management, maintaining this documentation, and a variety of other tasks requiring technical expertise.

A Digital Archive developer must be familiar with the following technologies:

- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Python
- SQL
- XML
- Omeka
- Zend Framework
- [GitHub](developer/github.md)
- Linux
- Elasticsearch
- AWS S3

### Digital Archive plugins

Digital Archive plugin documentation is in a separate category because it should be of interest to
everyone except for end users.

-   **Archivists** should be familiar with the features of various plugins
-   **Administrators** need to know how to configure plugins
-   **Developers** install, maintain and enhance plugins
