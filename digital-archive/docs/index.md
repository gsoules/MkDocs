** Categories**

> **[User documentation](user-about.md)** is for people who use the Digital Archive for research or just for fun.
They search for information and enjoy the results, but cannot make any changes to collection content.

> **[Archivist documentation](arch-about.md)** is for archivists and volunteers who maintain the collection content
for a Digital Archive site. They add new items, edit existing items, upload images, and establish relationships among items.

> **[Administrator documentation](admin-about.md)** is for the person who performs administrative functions
for their organization's Digital Archive site. They edit vocabularies, configure plugin options, add new user accounts,
define relationship types and rules, and perform other similar tasks.

> **[Superuser documentation](admin-about.md)** is for technical people responsible for system administration functions
for multiple Digital Archive sites. They are responsible for database management, software upgrades, web server management,
maintaining this documentation, and a variety of other tasks requiring technical expertise.

> **[Developer documentation](dev-about.md)** is for experienced programmers who maintain and enhance the Digital Archive software
to fix problems or add new features.

!!! note
    Some people will fall into more than one category. For example, an **Administrator** is usually also an
    **Archivist** and a **User**.
