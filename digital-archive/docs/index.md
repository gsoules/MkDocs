# Digital Archive Concepts

Items & Metadata
:   An **item** represents one *thing* in a Digital Archive collection. **Metadata** is information *about*
    an item such as what it is or who created it. Different kinds of information are are stored in separate
    metadata *fields* such as **_Title_**, **_Type_**, **_Subject_**, and **_Description_**.

    If you have used other kinds of databases, you might be more familiar with the terms *records* and *columns*
    rather than items and fields. They are the same thing.

    A small collection might have only a few hundred items whereas a large collection could have tens
    of thousands of items. How easy or difficult it will be for people to find items in a collection
    is affected by the quantity and quality of each item's metadata. Lots of good metadata that is specific to
    each item makes for good search results. Conversely, scant metadata, or metadata that is too broad for the
    item, negatively affects search results.

Type, Subject, and Keywords
:   An item's **type** tells you what kind of *thing* the item is. For example, an item's type might be `photograph`,
    `document`, or `teacup`. An item's **subject** clarifies its type. For example, an item of type `photograph`
    could have the subjects `person` and `boat` to indicate it's a photograph of. A subject is not required
    for an item when its type is self-explanatory such as *teacup*.
    
    **Keywords** are significant words in an item's **_Title_**, **_Description_** and all other metadata fields.
    There is no separate metadata field for keywords. They are simply the words an archivist choose to describe an item.
    [Learn about Type, Subject, and Keywords](../subjects).

    Each item can have only one type. Typically an item will have one or two subjects and many keywords.
    An archivist's choice of an item's type, subject, and keywords affect how easy it will be for a user to find the
    item when they search the collection.

Attachments
:   An item can have digital images (photographs or scans) and PDF files attached to it. Keywords in the text of
    a searchable PDF file implicitly become part of the item's keyword metadata just as if they appeared in
    the item's *Description* or other metadata field.  
    [Learn about attaching files to an item](../../archivist/add-new-item).

How Searching Works
:   When you type keywords in the search box, the Digital Archive examines all of the items in the collection
    looking for those keywords in *every metadata field* and in every searchable PDF. It does not matter which
    metadata field contains the words you are looking for; if the words exist somewhere in an item's metadata,
    that item will show up as a search result. However, when the keywords appear in the item's **_Title_** or
    **_Description_** metadata fields, the item will likely appear higher up in the search results because those
    two fields are the most relevant for search purposes. [Learn How to Search](../../user/how-to-search).

Facets
:   In addition to keyword searching, you can find items by drilling down into a collection
    based on its **_Subject_**, __*Type*__, **_Place_**, and **_Date_** **facets**.
    Facets appears in the **_Refine Your Search_** panel. 
    
    Facets let you find items of interest with just a few mouse clicks. For example, if you are looking for images
    of boats, but don't know what kind of boats are in the collection, you can use the **_Type_** and **_Subject_**
    facets to narrow down search results to `Photographs` of `Vessels`. You can then further narrow down the
    results to something more specific such as `Sailboat`.
    
    You can use facets in combination with keyword searching to, for example, find items where the type is `Photograph`,
    the subject is `Vessels`, and the item contains the keyword `military`.  
    [Learn How to Search using Facets](../../user/how-to-search/#facets).

Relationships
:   Relationships show how items are related to each other. For example, a collection might have three photographs
    of a person plus a document about that person's life. These items are related because the photographs depict
    the person and the document is about the person in the photographs.
    [Learn about Relationships](../relationships).

    The Digital Archive displays related items together so that when you see one item you also see its related items.
    For example, if a search turns up one of the photos of the person, you'll also see the other two photos and the
    document. For this to work, an archivist must establish relationships among the items in the collection.

Search Results
:   A search can return many items. You can [view search results](../../user/viewing-search-results) as a
    **table**, a **grid**, or an **index** (like at the back of a book). You can [share results](../../user/sharing)
     with friends and colleages and [print results to a PDF file](../../user/printing). You can easily find items that you
    recently viewed without having to search for them again, and you can save and organize items in a [digital
    notebook](../../user/digital-notebook). These topics are covered in the *For Users* documentation.
