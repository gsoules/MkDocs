# Superuser documentation

---

**Superuser** documentation is for technical people responsible for system administration functions for multiple Digital Archive sites. They are responsible for database management, software upgrades, web server management, maintaining this documentation, and a variety of other tasks requiring technical expertise.

The term `superuser` originates from way back in the world of computing where the superuser refers to a special user account
that grants super powerful access to, and the ability to make changes to, virtually every aspect of a computing environment.
