# Benefits

The Digital Archive provides a number of benefits, many of which are not available in other collection
managements systems. This section lists some of the most important benefits.
---

PDF file searching
:   Keyword searches include the [text of PDF files](/archivist/what-gets-searched/#what-a-keyword-search-finds).
    For archives having a large number of textual PDFs, it vastly increases the likelihood of finding
    what you are looking for. Without it, a search only finds text in an item's metadata fields.
    Requires the [AvantElasticsearch](/plugins/avantelasticsearch/) plugin.

Shared searching across collections
:   Multiple organizations can share their collection so that a user can
    [search one site or all sites](/user/how-to-search/#search-one-site-or-all-sites).  Requires the
    [AvantElasticsearch](/plugins/avantelasticsearch/) plugin.

Facet searching
:   [Facet searching](/user/how-to-search/#search-using-facets) quickly narrows down search results,
    or narrows all items in a collection to just those of interest.
    Requires the [AvantSearch](/plugins/avantsearch/) and [AvantElasticsearch](/plugins/avantelasticsearch/) plugins.

Index View
:   [Index View](/user/viewing-search-results/#index-view) shows search results as a compact, alphabetized list
    of unique values indexed by a specific field. Requires the [AvantSearch](/plugins/avantsearch/) plugin.

Relationships
:   [Relationships](/relationships/getting-started-relationships/) show how two or more people, places, or things are connected
    to each other in the real world.  Requires the [AvantRelationships](/plugins/avantrelationships/) plugin.

Support for archival assets using Amazon S3
:   You can access your S3 archival assets (full-size, high resolution files) with a single click. Requires the [AvantS3](/plugins/avantS3/) plugin.

Common Vocabulary
:   The [Common Vocabulary](/archivist/common-vocabulary/) is a set of vocabulary terms
    that multiple organizations can share to provide consistency among their collections.
    Requires the [AvantVocabulary](/plugins/avantvocabulary/) plugin.

Zoomable images
:   A [zoomable image](/administrator/zoomable-images/#zoomable-images) is a very high resolution image that you can zoom in on
    to see more detail. Requires the [AvantZoom](/plugins/avantzoom/) plugin.

Open Source
:   The Digital Archive is open source software (free and non-proprietary) that an organization can modify or extend based on
    its own needs.
