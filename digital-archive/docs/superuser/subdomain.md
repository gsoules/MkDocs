# Subdomain considerations

This page points out things you need to consider if installing the Digital Archive in a subdomain

## Server subdomain vs DNS subdomain
- digitalarchive.avantogic.net
- digitalcollections.edu

## FTP access

You don't need to set up FTP access to a subdomain.
You access a subdomain's files via the domain's FTP connection.
