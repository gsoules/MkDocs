# About this documentation

This documentation is for:

- Users
- Archivists
- Administrators
- Developers

Users
:   **User documentation** is for people who use the Digital Archive for research or just for fun.

    A user can see all public items in a Digital Archive collection,
    but has no access to non-public items or private fields.

    A user cannot edit or add items unless they log in as an **Archivist** or **Administrator**.

    See [Getting Started for Users](/user/getting-started-user)

Archivists
:   **Archivist documentation** is for archivists and volunteers who maintain the collection content
    for a Digital Archive site. They can add new items, edit existing items, attach images and PDF
    files to items, edit vocabularies, and establish relationships among items.

    An archivist has a user name and password that allows them to log in to a Digital Archive site. Once logged in, they
    can see all public items in the collection as well as non-public items and private fields.

    An archivist cannot make changes to a Digital Archive installation unless
    they log in as an **Administrator**.

    See [Getting Started for Archivists](/archivist/getting-started-archivist)

Administrators
:   **Administrator documentation** is for the person who performs administrative functions for their organization's
    Digital Archive site. They can configure plugin options, add new user accounts, define relationship
    types and rules, and perform other such tasks.

    An administrator has a user name and password that allow them to login to a Digital Archive site. Once logged in, they
    have all the privileges of an **Archivist**, but can also perform administrative functions.

    Documentation for administrators is in the **Site Administration** section.  
    See [Getting Started for Administrators](/administrator/getting-started-administrator)

    An administrator cannot modify Digital Archive functionality unless they are also a **Developer**.

Developers
:   **Developer documentation** is for technical people responsible for maintaining multiple Digital Archive sites.
    They are responsible for database management, programming, software upgrades, web server management,
    maintaining this documentation, and a variety of other tasks requiring technical expertise.

    Documentation for developers is the **Technology** section.
